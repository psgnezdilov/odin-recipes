        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pulpo gallego, or Galician-style octopus, is a popular tapa (appetizer) served all over Spain today. It originated in the northwestern Spanish region of Galicia where octopus (pulpo in Spanish) is a specialty and a common catch for local fishermen.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds octopus, frozen</li>
            <li>4 large potatoes </li>
            <li>1/4 cup Spanish extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste </li>
            <li>1 dash sweet Spanish paprika </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. </li>
            <li>Boil a large pot of water over high heat. Remove 1 1/2 pounds octopus from the freezer and place it directly in the boiling water. Cook until tender—this usually takes about 1 hour for a 1- to 2-pound octopus. To test its tenderness, insert a knife where the legs and head meet. If it goes in easily, it's ready to eat. </li>
            <li>Remove the octopus from the water and allow it to cool. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Cut the chilled meat into bite-sized chunks, slicing the legs in 1/2-inch rounds and the head into thin strips. </li>
            <li>Rinse 4 large potatoes and clean with a vegetable brush. Fill a medium-sized pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil the potatoes until they can easily be pierced with a fork, about 25 to 25 minutes. </li>
            <li>Drain the potatoes and rinse under cold running water. Allow the potatoes to cool, then peel. Slice into rounds approximately 1/3-inch thick. </li>
            <li>Arrange the potato slices on a serving platter. Place the octopus on top. Drizzle with 1/2 cup Spanish extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt and sweet paprika over top and serve. </li>
        </ol>
