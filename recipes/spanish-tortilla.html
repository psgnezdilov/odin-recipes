        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spanish <i>tortilla</i> (or Spanish omelette) is made with thinly sliced potatoes, onions, and eggs, gently cooked in olive oil. It is also known as <i>Torta Espanola</i> or <i>Torta de Patates</i> and it is best served at room temperature or even cold, which is why it is the perfect make-ahead dish!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 medium eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp sweet Spanish paprika, optional</li>
            <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2lb russet potatoes (or 2 to 3 russet potatoes), peeled, halved and sliced cross-wise</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, peeled, halved and sliced cross-wise</li>
            <li>4 scallions, trimmed, chopped (both white and green portions)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a big bowl, whisk together the eggs, salt and paprika. Set aside for now</li>
            <li>Prepare a 10-inch oven-proof nonstick skillet or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet. Heat the olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking.</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes, onions, and scallions to the oil (at first, they won't all seem to fit, but with a little stirring, they'll compress as they cook). Lower the heat immediately to medium-low and watch to control the heat and make sure it simmers gently. Cook for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are very tender.</li>
            <li>Use a heat-safe strainer over a heat-safe bowl to drain the olive oil (reserve the oil aside for now).</li>
            <li>Season the potatoes well with kosher salt and add them to the egg mixture in the bowl.</li>
            <li>Turn the oven broiler on.</li>
            <li>In the skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the reserved olive oil over medium heat. Pour in the egg and potato mixture, and gently press to even out the top. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook until you see the edges of the omelette begin to set and firm up then put the pan under the broiler to finish cooking. Broil for about 5 minutes, watching carefully until the eggs are cooked through and the top of the omelette browns slighlty (see notes if you prefer to finish cooking on stovetop).</li>
            <li>Allow the tortilla a few minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>To serve, invert the tortilla onto a large serving platter (you may need to loosen the edges using a spatulla). Cut into 6 slices and serve.</li>
        </ol>
